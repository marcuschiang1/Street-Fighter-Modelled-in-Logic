The goal for these jape proofs is to conclude Q. We will simulate a scenario that proves our model works using the mechanics of street fighter. Lets say that each player performs a throw, this will result in a throw break and lead to Q, which means a successful attempt at defence/offence. 

- Q means that P1 succesfully dealt with the situation
- R followed by a number denotes a jump and which player performed the jump

First proof: Players are in positions right next to eachother, so we conclude adjacent.Player 2 (NPC) is performing a punch (P2) and this means that we cannot block(negation of B) since they cannot perform two actions at once.Player 1 needs to make the best possible move.If Player 2 is  not  blocking,  and player  1 performs a shoryuken,  and they  areadjacent, this means that the shoryuken connects concluding Player 2 is dam-aged.  Player 2 being damaged implies Player 1 has successfully dealt with thesituation and we have proven the best possible move

Second proof: Player  1  is  in  position  1  and  player  2  is  in  position  4,  implying  three  spacesbetween them.  Three spaces between is a constraint that dictates the range ofhadouken.  If player 1 jumps (as a defence) while a hadouken is being thrown,this is a solution to the situation.  Player 1 is jumping, therefore we can deduce Q (successful move).

Third proof: Player 1 is in position 0 and player 2 is in position 1, we can deduce that they
are adjacent.  Player 2 executes a throw,  only works if adjacent (as shown inthrow break proposition).  If player 2 is trying to throw player 1, the solutionis to break the throw by returning a throw of your own.  A break implies thatplayer 1 has successfully dealt with the situation,  so we deduce Q (successfulmove).
